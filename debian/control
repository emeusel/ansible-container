Description: Ansible Container is a tool for building Docker images and orchestrating containers using Ansible playbooks.
 Ansible Container is the ultimate workflow for container development,
 testing, and deployment.

 Ansible Container enables you to build Docker images and orchestrate
 containers using only Ansible playbooks. Describe your application
 in a Docker Compose-like format and, rather than using a Dockerfile,
 provide a playbook with tasks for building images. Ansible Container
 will take it from there.

 With Ansible Container, you are no longer limited by Dockerfile. You
 can now apply the power of Ansible to the image build process. Use
 templates, copy files, drop in encrypted data, handle errors, add
 conditionals, and more. Everything Ansible brings to orchestrating
 your infrastructure can now be applied to the image build process.

 But Ansible Container does not stop there. Use Ansible Container to
 run the application, and push images to private and public
 registries. When you are ready to deploy to the cloud, use it to
 generate an Ansible role that automates the deployment.

 This package installs the library for Python 3.
